# Quiz-Game
A small quiz game using DevTools Console

This is a small quiz game built using JavaScript

## Game Implementation:
1. Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should include:
a) question itself
b) the answers from which the player can choose the correct one
c) correct answer (I would use a number for this)

2. Create a couple of questions using the constructor

3. Store them all inside an array

4. Select one random question and log it on the console, together with the possible answers

5. Use the 'prompt' function to ask the user for the correct answer. The user should input the number of the correct answer.

6. Check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct or not

7. After display the result, display the next random question, so that the game never ends

8. The game literally never ends. So include the option to quit the game if the user writes 'exit' instead of the answer. 

9. Track the user's score. So each time an answer is correct, add 1 point to the score (Use closure technique).

10. Display the score in the console.
